# Research Algoirthms course, Ariel University

## By Tom Shabalin.

### About:
Through the Research Algorithm course, we needed to implement an advanced algorithm from a paper research.

In addition to this, every week we were given 2 python tasks, which supposed to get our python and programming skills to a higher level.

### How to run
In each folder there are python files, with a complete exmaples written as a doctest methods for each function.

In order to run it do the following:
```bash
# Clone the reposityro
$ git clone https://github.com/MightyArty/Research_Algo_MidTasks.git
# Go into the repository
$ cd Research_Algo_MidTasks
# Make sure python is installed on your PC
# Open a new terminal
# Go into the desired folder
$ cd (Assignment-2 / Assignment-3 / ...)
$ Run "python file_name.py"
# In some files, the doctest method is in a comment, you should remove the comment in order to see how the function performs under different inputs.
```
